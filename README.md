# Copies of my program preferences, most hopefully up to date

## Preference files

* .vimrc

## TODO: 
    Need to find out a better way to version control preference files... .vimrc is stuck in the $HOME directory on a windows machine, but I don't want a git repo there... I also don't want to have to keep copying it over here every time I update, mostly because I'm worried I'll forget to update and push.
    Best solution is to finally make a permanent switch to a Linux work machine, and set a CRON to copy paste commit and push on a weekly basis.
